## ðŸ‘“ At a Glance

`Vootstrap` is a collection of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) components with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) under the hood.

While `Vootstrap` is a carefully thought-out combination of `Vue` and `Bootstrap` frameworks, it gives you an incredible simplicity and makes your frontend programming experience much more enjoyable ðŸŽ‰

It works well for both websites and hybrid mobile apps. You can use popular components from `Bootstrap` filled with the power of reactive programming given by `Vue`.

The main advantage of `Vootstrap` is the syntax. The entire library is built with keeping in mind the idea of unbelievable flexibility. It's easy enough for beginners and helpful for experienced developers.

## ðŸš€ How to Get Started

Copy [vootstrap.js](vootstrap.js) to your project.

## âœ” Requirements

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

## âŒ¨ Usage

Each `Vootstrap` component is actually an HTML tag that you can simply put into your layout.

**For now, [Button](#buttons) is the only component supported by `Vootstrap`. New components will be supported soon.**

Also, take a look at [demo app](demo/index.html) which gives the base understanding of amazing `Vootstrap` principles.

### Buttons

Simple primary button:

```html
<vt-button-primary title="My button"></vt-button-primary>
```

The same button outlined:

```html
<vt-button-primary-outline title="My button"></vt-button-primary-outline>
```

You can also change the size:

```html
<vt-button-success-outline-small title="Small button"></vt-button-success-outline-small>
<vt-button-warning-outline-large title="Large button"></vt-button-warning-outline-large>
```

One of the fundamental `Vootstrap` features is ability to swap tag name components. All the examples below are correct:

```html
<vt-button-primary-outline-large title="My button"></vt-button-primary-outline-large>
<vt-button-primary-large-outline title="My button"></vt-button-primary-large-outline>
<vt-button-outline-primary-large title="My button"></vt-button-outline-primary-large>
<vt-button-primary-large title="My button"></vt-button-primary-large>
<vt-button-large-primary title="My button"></vt-button-large-primary>
```

So you don't need to use CSS classes like `btn-primary`, `btn-lg`, etc. Just put button's style information into the tag and use it like a regular button.
